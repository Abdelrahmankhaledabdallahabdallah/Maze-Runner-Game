# Maze-Runner-Game
Welcome to the Maze Runner game! This repository holds the source code for a Pac-Man-inspired game set within a maze. You'll navigate as the maze runner, collecting gifts, avoiding bombs, and ultimately finding your escape.

**Game Description:**

Explore a 30x30 maze (minimum size) filled with obstacles, gifts, and bombs. Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze runner and the spacebar to fire your weapon (with limited ammo) at obstacles. The goal is to reach the exit gate without hitting too many bombs.
